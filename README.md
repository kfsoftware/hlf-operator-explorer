# HLF Operator UI

The HLF Operator UI provides a graphical interface for a convenient blockchain-as-a-service user experience. Once the operator is set up it's very easy for teams to create, clone, watch, edit and delete their own Certificate Authorities, Peers and Orderer nodes.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create Fabric CAs from the user interface
- [ ] Create Fabric Peers from the user interface
- [ ] Create Fabric Orderer Nodes from the user interface
- [ ] Managing chaincodes
